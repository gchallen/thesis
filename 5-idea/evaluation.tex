\section{Evaluation}
\label{idea-sec-evaluation}

To evaluate IDEA, we built and tested the energy-aware component and
application described in Section~\ref{idea-sec-casestudies}. For the routing
component, we compare the performance of our IDEA-based implementations to an
approach that is not energy-aware. For the application, we use IDEA to
implement several energy objective functions and compare their performance
against each other and against a heuristic that does not consider energy
availability.

\subsection{Experimental Setup}
\label{idea-subsec-experimentalsetup}

Throughout the evaluation we present results run in several different
environments. We have implemented IDEA for TinyOS in order to run experiments
on MoteLab~\cite{motelab}, our 180~node wireless sensor network testbed. We
also present results obtained using TOSSIM~\cite{tossim}, the TinyOS
simulator. TOSSIM incorporates a closest-fit pattern matching noise model to
accurately capture complex link dynamics~\cite{cpm-ipsn07}. TOSSIM allows us
to run longer experiments incorporating various solar charging models. To
improve the realism of TOSSIM we began with a modified version developed for
the Koala project~\cite{koala-ipsn08} and performed further modifications to
correctly simulate the operation of low-power listening
(LPL), which is important to properly model the power
consumption of the radio for the ICTP experiments. We use information
collected on MoteLab to build a realistic TOSSIM radio model for our
simulations. Finally, for the application we built a Python simulator to
allow rapid prototyping of various energy objective functions.

IDEA is designed to tune components in the face of variations in both load
and charging rates, and to test this we present experiments using solar
charging data collected off of a solar panel deployed on an Arlington, MA
rooftop in March, 2009. Battery levels are calculated using a charging model
based on a Nickel-Metal Hydride battery technology with a 66\% charging
efficiency. We attenuate this data to simulate the charging produced by solar
panels of several different sizes in order to evaluate IDEA's performance as
available energy changes. We also perform experiments with a randomly
attenuated charging profile to simulate bad solar panel placement or
obstacles to incident sunlight effecting the spatial distribution of
collected energy.

For our MoteLab experiments we determine the system's ability to span periods
without charging inputs. We use two sets of initial conditions based on the
interaction between the charging data we collected and the capacity of the
batteries deployed. If the solar panel is large enough it will provide
considerable charging input and completely charge small batteries during the
day, so that all nodes begin the night with full batteries. If the solar
panel is not large enough to completely charge the batteries nodes will begin
the night with varying amounts of charge depending on their load rates during
the day.

Energy tracking is done by IDEA using a software-only approach developed for
the Pixie~\cite{pixie-sensys08} project. The component captures state
transitions and applies an energy consumption model for each state based on
current consumption measured offline. In the future we would like to
integrate a more accurate hardware-driven approach such as
iCount~\cite{icount-spots08}. The short lifetimes for some experiments are
explained by the use of extremely small batteries, which were chosen to allow
experiments to complete in reasonable amounts of time. We expect that
application developers will want to use a battery size and charging
technology suitable to allow their system to achieve a desired level of
performance, and the improvements in energy efficiency possible using IDEA
will allow smaller batteries or solar panels to be used, reducing the size
and cost of the hardware package.

Experiments for the energy-aware routing case use the first-node death energy
objective function described in
Section~\ref{idea-subsec-energyobjectivefunctions}, and therefore we evaluate
the network lifetime as the time at which the first node runs out of energy.
Our distributed localization application illustrates the process of designing
an effective energy objective function when the overall goal of the system is
known.

\subsection{ICTP: Energy-Aware Routing}

\begin{figure}[t]

\includegraphics[width=0.7\hsize]{./5-idea/figs/ictp.pdf}\\
\end{center}

\caption{\textit{Qualitative comparison of stock CTP and ICTP.} For this
experiment odd-numbered nodes (shaded) were set to charging rapidly, while
even-numbered nodes were not charging. Unmodified CTP builds the tree shown
in (a), which routes many packets through the even nodes. ICTP builds the
tree shown in (b), which moves all even nodes to leaf roles.}

\label{idea-fig-ictpqualitative}
\end{figure}

Using IDEA we were able to integrate energy awareness into CTP, the routing
protocol included as part of TinyOS. For these experiments each node in a
20~node network is sending packets to the sink at the rate of 6 packets per
second. Static LPL intervals of 0.5 second were used. 

Figure~\ref{idea-fig-ictpqualitative} shows a qualitative demonstration of
the differences between energy-aware and non-energy-aware routing trees. This
TOSSIM simulation ran with all odd numbered nodes charging rapidly and all
even numbered nodes not charging (with the exception of the sink, Node 118,
which we assume is powered). While this is an unrealistic charging pattern,
it produces a clear difference in the routing protocol behavior.
Figure~\ref{idea-fig-ictpqualitative}(a) shows that unmodified CTP is unaware
of these charging differences and puts several even nodes, such as Node 92,
into positions where they are routing for multiple nodes. The total number of
nodes upstream from even numbered nodes in the stock CTP case is 14. In
contrast, ICTP realizes that the odd-numbered nodes have energy to spare and
the even-numbered nodes are lacking, and moves all even nodes to leaf roles.
None of the even nodes in Figure~\ref{idea-fig-ictpqualitative} are routing
data.

Using a 20~node subset of our MoteLab topology, we compared the performance
of ICTP to unmodified CTP using 24-hour TOSSIM simulations and the three
different solar charging scenarios previously described. As
Table~\ref{idea-table-ictpvoptimaltossim} shows, ICTP shows improvements in
lifetime over stock CTP of between 11 and 27\%. The different routing trees
formed by ICTP did not effect the packet delivery rates appreciably with the
largest change in packet delivery rate being 2.8\% (97.8\% for CTP vs. 95.0\%
for ICTP).

Finally, Table~\ref{idea-table-etxsearchradius} shows how IDEA can trade off
application utility with the energy objective function. The simulation
experiment uses a 25~node grid topology and, similar to the previous
experiment, half the nodes are charging rapidly while the other half are not.
Here our application-defined metric is expected transmissions to reach the
sink (ETX). A purely ETX-based tree will use the shortest route without
routing around the uncharging nodes, whereas an energy-aware tree will avoid
the uncharging nodes by constructing longer routes. We expect that,
prioritizing ETX will cause the total ETX of the entire tree --- defined as
the sum of the ETX of all the routes in use --- to decrease, while
prioritizing energy performance will cause the first-node lifetime of the
tree to increase.

Indeed, Table~\ref{idea-table-etxsearchradius} confirms this is the case. For
each experiment, we restrict the set of acceptable parents to be the minimum
available parent ETX plus an extra amount we call the ETX search margin. For
example, if the minimum available parent ETX is 5 and the ETX search margin
is 10, then we will consider all parents with ETX < 15. As the search margin
increases, IDEA will examine longer routes that may provide better energy
performance. As the table shows, increasing the ETX search margin leads to
longer average routes but also improves overall network lifetime.

\caption{\textit{ICTP performance with solar charging.} The table summarizes
the improvements in performance obtained by replacing CTP with ICTP. Three
different solar charging profiles are used corresponding to a large panel

not completely charge all batteries during the day, and a randomly attenuated
charging profile that varies node-to-node.}

\subsection{Distributed Localization}

To evaluate the distributed localization application we built a Python
simulator, which improves significantly on TOSSIM performance for hundreds of
nodes and allowed rapid iteration and experimentation with different energy
objective functions. Our simulator models acoustic event sources within the
sensor network, each of which triggers a distributed localization operation.
The energy overheads of communication, both the leader election process and
the subsequent data transfer, are modeled in the simulator based on empirical
measurements taken on our MoteLab testbed.

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\hsize]{./5-idea/figs/localizationdensityvtime.pdf}
\end{center}

\caption{\textbf{Energy density over time.} Energy densities for the
\texttt{Closest} heuristic and IDEA using the \texttt{WeightedEnergy}
objective function are shown at four points in time. The event distribution
is uniform. IDEA enables better load distribution, which leads to a longer
application lifetime.}

\label{idea-fig-localizationdensityvtime}
\end{figure}

For these experiments we arranged 100 nodes into a 100~m by 100~m area,
resulting in the placements shown in
Figure~\ref{idea-fig-localizationdensityvtime}. We simulate a sensing range
equal to the communication range, each set to 20~m, and randomize the
reliable transfer protocol bandwidth across each link to between 768 and
1280~bytes/sec, a feasible range based on results from data transfer
protocols such as Flush~\cite{flush-sensys07} and Fetch. Events are simulated
using a uniform random distribution so that events have equal probability of
occurring anywhere in the sensor field.

To evaluate network performance, we define \textit{capability} of the network
as the percent of the last 100 operations that succeeded, where success is
defined as localizing the event. We assume that the application requires that
the network be able to localize 90\% of events that occur, and design our
energy objective functions with this in mind. We quote the system lifetime as
the the 90\% capability time, that is the time at which the network's
capability drops below 90\%.

We experimented with several approaches to choosing a localization plan, one
that does not use IDEA and three that do using different energy objective
functions:

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{\texttt{Closest}:} produces a localization plan with the node
closest to the event source as the aggregator and the three next closest
nodes as signal providers. We assume a real solution would use an imperfect
estimate of proximity such as total signal energy or signal-to-noise ratio,
but for the simulations we use the known simulated event location to choose
the closest nodes. \texttt{Closest} does not require energy state information
and so could be implemented without IDEA. It is implemented as an example of
a plausible non-energy-aware solution.

\item \textbf{\texttt{MaxEnergy}:} chooses the node with the most energy
(that heard the event) as aggregator and the next three highest-energy nodes
as signal providers.

\item \textbf{\texttt{TotalEnergy}:} chooses the localization plan that
consumes the lowest amount of total energy summed across all nodes in the
network.

\item \textbf{\texttt{WeightedEnergy}:} weights the total energy consumption
using a similarity metric derived from the cosine similarity index to measure
the degree to which the energy vector for the localization plan is a good
``fit'' given the current energy availability.

\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\hsize]{./5-idea/figs/ideavheuristics.pdf}
\end{center}

\caption{\textit{Performance of IDEA objective functions and heuristic.}
Simulation results are shown for the localization application. The graph
compares the \texttt{Closest} heuristic, implemented without using IDEA,
against three different IDEA objective functions: \texttt{MaxEnergy},
\texttt{TotalEnergy} and \texttt{WeightedEnergy}. The \texttt{WeightedEnergy}
approach using IDEA outperforms the non-energy-aware approach while the other
objective functions perform more poorly.}

\label{idea-fig-ideavheuristics}
\end{figure}

We began by experimenting with the \texttt{Closest}, \texttt{MaxEnergy} and
\texttt{TotalEnergy} approaches. As Figure~\ref{idea-fig-ideavheuristics}
shows, the \texttt{Closest} heuristic outperformed the two IDEA-based
approaches.  However, when examining the energy density plot shown in
Figure~\ref{idea-fig-localizationdensityvtime} for the \texttt{Closest}
heuristic we could see that it led to concentrations of available energy on
nodes at dense locations on the irregular grid. This is despite the uniform
distribution of acoustic event sources, which one might expect to produce
good energy load distribution without the need for tuning. After exploring
several additional approaches we found an energy objective function capable
of producing extremely good load distribution, the \texttt{WeightedEnergy}
approach described above. Figure~\ref{idea-fig-ideavheuristics} shows that
it outperforms \texttt{Closest}, increasing the network's lifetime by 15\%,
while Figure~\ref{idea-fig-localizationdensityvtime} illustrates how it
utilizes all the nodes' available energy. Our experience with the
localization application illustrates the role of the proper energy objective
function in enabling good application performance, and points to the
increases in system lifetime possible through better energy distribution.
