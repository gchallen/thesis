This dissertation presents architectural solutions that improve the
performance of scientific sensor networks. Wireless sensor networks composed
of tens or hundreds of low-power, resource-constrained devices, can aid
scientific exploration by collecting data at scales difficult to achieve with
traditional instrumentation. To do so, they must provide high-fidelity data
suitable for scientific study, identify and devote system resources to the
data most valuable to the application, and respond to fluctuations in energy
availability. Our thesis is that by managing distributed resource usage, we
can improve the data quality provided by sensor networks to scientific
applications.

We make three core contributions. First, working with volcano seismologists,
we have designed and evaluated the first sensor network enabling the study of
erupting volcanos. Through three field studies we validated that it produces
data suitable for scientific analysis. We found verifying the timing accuracy
of our data both difficult and important and were able to develop a new
\textit{post-hoc} time-rectification technique that can reconstruct accurate
timestamps in the face of timing protocol failures.

Second, we developed Lance, a general-purpose architecture targeting high
data-rate sensor networks. Lance manages data-collection in order to direct
energy and bandwidth resources toward the most interesting signals. Valuable
data is identified using a two-tiered architecture that leverages the
increased visibility of a network controller while limiting the overhead of
centralized control. Lance has been used to support volcano studies as well
as the Mercury project, which enables monitoring of patients with
neuromuscular disorders. We show that Lance's resource allocation heuristic
achieves near-optimal efficiency, within 5\% of an offline optimal solution
in most cases.

Finally, we present IDEA (Integrated Distributed Energy Awareness), a sensor
network service allowing system components to tune their behavior in response
to changing energy availability. This allows the network to adjust energy
load as availability changes, which is particularly important when nodes are
harvesting energy. We have used IDEA to build energy-aware routing and MAC
protocols and measured the performance improvement they provide over
non-energy-aware solutions. By better distributing energy consumption, IDEA
can extend network lifetimes by up to 27\%.
