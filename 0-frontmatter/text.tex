% 07 May 2010 : GWA : Murakami Quote.

{\ssp
\epigram
\begin{quote} 
You defend yourself\\
against the belief\\
It is all for nothing\\
against the fear\\
You may not have it in you.

\vspace*{0.1in}
You defend your work today\\
But it has been defended, many days\\
The struggle is within\\
and among us\\
Over what we think is possible

\vspace*{0.1in}

There is a grime\\
Rising off the sidewalks\\
It cakes and distorts our vision\\
But not yours.\\
You see the colors that blaze.

\vspace*{0.1in}

Creature of unusual brightness\\
You rest of my finger\\
Tickling my skin, I silently hope\\
You will remain\\
Warming yourself in summer rays

\vspace*{0.1in}
Through your eyes I see\\
This place has been good to us\\
This place has been good\\
For you, and for you being\\
For me, and all our memories

\vspace*{0.1in}
We will take them to Buffalo\\
Shiny polished marbles\\
Spilling out of our pockets\\
And it has been good to you here\\
And it will be good to you there.
\end{quote}
