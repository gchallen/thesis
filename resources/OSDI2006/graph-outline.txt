Robustness
----------
  - Node reliability vs time [MDW]
  - Node reliability vs node [MDW]
     -> With and without infrastructure failures

  - Node reboots [KL]
    - Determine manual vs. automatic reboots
    - Correlate reboots to other node properties (routing load?)
    - Impact of reboot (latency)

Event detection
---------------
  - Overall statistics: [MDW]
    - Number events detected vs. node
    - Number events detected vs. time

  - Event detector accuracy vs. Reftek data [MDW]
    - Vary E.D. parameters
  - Global detector accuracy [MDW]
    - How well did global detector filter out false events
    - Specificity/sensitivity analysis

Performance
-----------
  - Yield [MDW]
    - % of detected events that we successfully downloaded data for
    - How much data per event
    - Consider all nodes vs. only "active" nodes
    - Before and after reprogram

  - Throughput [MDW]
    - Bytes/sec
    - Latency for data transfer
    - Vs. node or hopcount

Timing
------
  - FTSP stability: How often did FTSP go down and for how long? [GWA]
  - % of events with 'good' FTSP timing  [GWA]
  - Accuracy of time rectification on Teloslab [GWA]
    - Vary time rectification parameters

Fidelity
--------
  - xcorr with Node 213 and Reftek data [GWA]
    - Relate to timing confidence: Are events with good FTSP timing 
      more accurate?

  - Arrival time distribution across the array [KL]
    - Back-projection to possible event sources
    - Consistency with Reftek data
