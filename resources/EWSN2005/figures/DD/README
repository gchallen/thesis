1) DDpowerconsumpmA.dat : power consumption for the distributed detector.  Y
in milliAmps, X in seconds.

2-4) DDpowerconsumpmAsmoothed[10,100,350].dat : power consumption smoothed
with a moving average over X samples for the distributed detector.  Y in
milliAmps, X in seconds.

5) CONTpowerconsumpmA.dat : power consumption for the continuous detector.  Y
in milliAmps, X in seconds.

6-8) CONTpowerconsumpmAsmoothed[10,100,350].dat : power consumption smoothed
with a moving average over X samples for the continuous detector.  Y in
milliAmps, X in seconds.

9-17) [1-8,total]bandwidth.dat : packet payload bandwidth figures for 0.1 sec
intervals.  Hard to see the voting phase in here because the data transfer
dominates.

18-26) [1-8,total]packetssec.dat : packets/sec figures for 0.1 sec intervals.
