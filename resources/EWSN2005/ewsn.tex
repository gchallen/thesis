\begin{abstract}
This paper describes our experiences using a wireless sensor
network to monitor volcanic eruptions with low-frequency acoustic
sensors. We developed a wireless sensor array and deployed it in July 2004 at
Volc\'{a}n Tungurahua, an active volcano in central Ecuador.
The network collected infrasonic (low-frequency
acoustic) signals at 102~Hz, transmitting data over a 9~km wireless
link to a remote base station. During the deployment, we collected
over 54~hours of continuous data which included at least 9~large
explosions. Nodes were time-synchronized using a separate GPS
receiver, and our data was later correlated with that acquired at a
nearby wired sensor array. In addition to continuous sampling, 
we have developed a distributed event detector that automatically
triggers data transmission when a well-correlated signal is received
by multiple nodes. We evaluate this approach in terms of reduced
energy and bandwidth usage, as well as accuracy of infrasonic
signal detection.
