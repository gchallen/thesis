TODO for camera-ready

------------------------------------------------------------------------
As discussed 8/1/508

(Geoff, please mark these when they have been done)

- Graph showing motelab topology

- Run larger motelab experiment (50 nodes+?) with Zipfian ADU
  distribution to factor out the event source issue
  - This would replace Figure 10
  - Move this graph to beginning of testbed eval section

- Run motelab experiment using correlated policy module, and come up
  with graph showing ADUs downloaded for correlated vs. uncorrelated
  policy in use.

- Get rid of Figure 9

- Regenerate data for Figure 6

- Regenerate data for Figure 8

- Edit the eval.tex text to go with the new figures - of course.

- Deal with XXXnotes in eval.tex and throughout the paper.

-----

- Full editing pass.

- Fix all widows.

- Check figures are readable when printed in black and white.

Big stuff:

   Run simulations using simple linear topology and uniform utility
   distribution in the network with three policies: cost-naive,
   cost-total, and cost-bottleneck, and show how the distribution of
   data collected in the network varies.

   Calculate what the optimal utility extraction would be for the
   "realistic" volcano runs in the paper now and show them on the
   graph side-by-side.

   Graph out the network spatially and show a little pie chart on
   each node with three segments: idle, energy for data collection,
   energy for routing. Do a skewed utility distribution where
   utility attenuates with distance from some "source location".
   Show that nodes near the source spend more energy collecting
   local data, nodes along routing path use more energy routing,
   nodes further away mostly idle. (Somewhat like SORA results.)

Small stuff:

   Cite Madden paper

   Be sure to cite other related papers as necessary - wavescope? 

   Make mention of robustness of base station (well known failover
   techniques can be used)

   Explain that system can scale to multiple sinks - would need a way
   to coordinate download activity across multiple sinks?

   Address reviewer #1 nitpicks (many of them)

   Address reviewer #3 nitpicks (a couple)

   Cite video-based adaptive streaming - mentioned by two reviewers.
   Need good suggestion of which paper to cite.

   Clarify: "Each ADU contains the complete routing path" (Reviewer 3)

   Clarify the energy model vis-a-vis MAC behavior (Reviewer 3)

   Acknowledge Jeff Johnson, Hugo, others at IGEPN.
