The authors would like to acknowledge those who helped make this project
possible. Professors Jeff Johnson (New Mexico Tech) and Jonathan Lees
(University of North Carolina), our seismology collaborators, made the entire
endeavor happen, schooling computer scientists in the fine art of
volcanologic research and providing invaluable assistance with the design and
deployment of each of our systems. Mario Ruiz (IGEPN) and Omar Marcillo (New
Mexico Tech) provided additional domain science and deployment assistance.
Harvard students Konrad Lorincz, Pat Swieskowski and Stephen Dawson-Haggerty
helped design and implement the sensor network systems we deployed.
Researchers, staff and students at the Inst\'{i}tuto Geofisico, Escuela
Polit\'{e}cnica Nacional (IGEPN) in Ecuador provided essential ground support
during each of our deployments. Finally, Jim MacArthur and William Walker at
the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Circuit Lab aided
significantly in the design and construction of our interface board and
enclosures.
