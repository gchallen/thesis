\section{Future Work and Conclusions}
\label{idea-sec-futurework}

As future work we are interested in addressing the problem of cross-component
interaction to be able to optimize the operation of several IDEA components
running in the network simultaneously. This is complicated by the fact that
there is likely to be dependencies between components that cause decisions
made by one to affect others. As an example, the LPL intervals used by a node
would effect the power cost to use the link seen by the routing protocol.  In
addition we are investigating ways to model the impact of node failure on
other nodes. Many sensor network protocols will try to work around nodes
leaving the network or going offline, but this repair process is costly and
causes load within the network to shift.

To conclude, we have described the IDEA architecture in detail, motivated its
use through three examples, and demonstrated that for each example IDEA can
improve performance by better managing distributed energy resources. We have
also discussed the process of developing an application-specific energy
objective function and shown how this can improve the performance of a
localization application while maintaining application fidelity.
